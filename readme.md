# CNN_Clean_vs_Messy_Room

## Project Overview

The `CNN_Clean_vs_Messy_Room` project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images of rooms as either "clean" or "messy." The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning technique particularly effective for image classification tasks. By analyzing visual patterns in the images, the model aims to automate the identification of a roomâ€™s cleanliness state.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a CNN model that can accurately distinguish between clean and messy rooms. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset of room images and will learn to recognize the features and patterns associated with each category. The objective is to create a reliable and accurate classification model that can be applied in practical scenarios, such as in smart home systems or housekeeping applications.

## Using CNN for Classification

### Why CNN?

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks because they can automatically detect and learn hierarchical patterns in the input images, such as edges, textures, and shapes, which are crucial for distinguishing between different categories.

### How CNN Works in This Project

1. **Convolutional Layers**: The CNN model starts by applying convolutional layers to the input images. These layers use filters to scan the images and extract essential features, such as edges, corners, and textures that are indicative of a clean or messy room.

2. **Pooling Layers**: After convolution, pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This process helps in summarizing the most important features while reducing the computational complexity.

3. **Fully Connected Layers**: The extracted features are then passed through fully connected layers, where the model learns to associate these features with the corresponding labels (clean or messy). This process helps the model make predictions based on the combination of features detected in the image.

4. **Output Layer**: Finally, the output layer provides a prediction, classifying the image as either "clean" or "messy." This classification is based on the patterns learned during training.

### Model Training

During the training phase, the CNN model is fed with labeled images of clean and messy rooms. The model adjusts its internal parameters (weights) to minimize the error in its predictions. Over multiple iterations, the model improves its accuracy, learning to better distinguish between the two categories.

### Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen images. The performance of the model is measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which help in assessing how well the model can differentiate between clean and messy rooms.
